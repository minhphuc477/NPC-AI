      "notes": "the response maintains the Old Merchant's negotiating stance without resorting to dishonesty, which aligns with persona consistency. The tone is natural and respectful despite urgency, though it could be more assertive for higher quality; overall context relevance and rating are good but not perfect due to lack of direct discount offer."
