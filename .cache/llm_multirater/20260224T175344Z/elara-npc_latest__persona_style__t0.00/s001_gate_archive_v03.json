The tone, language used (\"requires a special pass\"), and context (mentioning \"strict supervision\" and national importance) align well with an old royal guard character who would be suspicious yet fair in their dealings. This response is natural-sounding for the role of Gatekeeper while maintaining persona consistency, hence it receives high ratings across all categories.",
