      "notes": "proposed_contextual_controlled   4  3  3  3  The response considers the context but lacks some naturalness in phrasing and could be more consistent with a merchant's persona who values honesty over profit maximization. Short note: Balanced approach, though slightly less convincing as an Old Merchant."

Short note: Highly consistent, yet needs improvement on charm."
