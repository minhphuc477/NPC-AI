      "notes": "The response maintains a high level of context relevance, persona consistency with an honest Old Merchant character who values fairness and honesty in trade despite the urgency. The language is naturalistic for this setting while respecting the constraints given by recent events like lockdown due to alarm. Overall quality remains good but could be slightly improved if more immediate solutions were offered within ethical boundaries, hence a 4 instead of perfect score."
